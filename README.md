# VeraMove

VeraMove is a standalone, mock-first AI moving-services negotiator. It turns voice or document
intake into one locked job specification, compares three vendors on identical facts, negotiates
with verified evidence, and explains its final ranking with transcript and recording references.

This public repository is a minimal hackathon starter for parallel development—not a production
moving, calling, or booking product.

## Product summary

The seeded demo proves this loop:

1. Create a structured two-bedroom `JobSpecV1` from synthetic intake.
2. Confirm and lock version 1.0.
3. Create three synthetic vendor calls with itemized outcomes.
4. Use a verified competing quote in a follow-up negotiation.
5. Measure a lower price and deposit.
6. Rank vendors and link reasons to transcript evidence and synthetic recording URLs.

## Architecture

FastAPI owns the canonical Pydantic contracts and generated OpenAPI schema. A small orchestration
service depends on repository, voice, negotiation, and discovery protocols. `APP_MODE=mock` wires
an in-memory repository and deterministic fixtures, so no external SDK or account is needed.

The Vite/React frontend has one API client and imports types generated from FastAPI OpenAPI. The
optional Supabase migration stores versioned payloads as JSONB, but no local database is required.

See [architecture details](docs/architecture.md), [API contract rules](docs/api-contract.md), and
[integration boundaries](docs/integration-boundaries.md).

## Team & roles

| Person | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| Toheeb ([@Olacode01](https://github.com/Olacode01)) | Backend orchestration, ElevenLabs voice/negotiation system |
| Zukhriuddin ([@zukhriddingit](https://github.com/zukhriddingit)) | Data & intelligence layer — schema, OpenAI parsing/comparison/recommendation, dataset |
| Northeastern teammate | Frontend (`apps/web`) |
| Arsalan ([@ars2711](https://github.com/ars2711)) | Product narrative & submission — everything in `docs/submission/`, final sign-off on the Project Summary, videos, and portal copy |

Full ownership boundaries and the claim-verification workflow are in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) and
[`CODEOWNERS`](CODEOWNERS). Submission materials — scripts, claim ledger, requirements mapping,
final checklist — live in [`docs/submission/`](docs/submission).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or newer
- Node.js 20.19 or newer with npm
- Git

No API credentials, Supabase project, telephony account, or local database is required.

## Five-minute local setup

```bash
git clone <repository-url> vera-move-negotiator
cd vera-move-negotiator
python scripts/bootstrap.py
python scripts/dev.py
```

Open the frontend at `http://127.0.0.1:5173`, FastAPI documentation at
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`, and health at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/health`.

Stop both development servers with Ctrl+C.

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` only if you want to override safe defaults.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `APP_MODE` | `mock` | Selects credential-free `mock` or fail-closed `live` voice mode |
| `API_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Documented API bind host |
| `API_PORT` | `8000` | Documented API port |
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8000` | Browser API base URL |
| `LIVE_CALLS_ENABLED` | `false` | Independent switch required before a controlled live call |
| `ELEVENLABS_*` | empty | Live agent, phone-number, webhook, and API configuration |
| `LIVE_TEST_TO_NUMBER` | empty | Externally supplied, opted-in live test destination |
| `OPENAI_DOCUMENT_MODEL` | `gpt-4.1-mini` | Unwired document parser model override |
| `OPENAI_RECOMMENDATION_MODEL` | `gpt-4.1-mini` | Unwired grounded narrator model override |

OpenAI, Tavily, and Supabase credential names remain reserved for unwired adapters. ElevenLabs
values are read only by the controlled live voice path and are validated when a call is initiated;
startup itself never dials. Never commit a populated `.env` file.

## Mock mode

Mock mode is the default complete demo mode. It uses process-local memory, so jobs disappear when
the API restarts. Calls, quotes, transcripts, recordings, discovery results, intelligence findings,
and negotiation results are deterministic synthetic fixtures. `APP_MODE=live` selects only the
controlled one-call voice adapter; it remains disabled without `LIVE_CALLS_ENABLED=true` and the
complete reviewed configuration documented in `docs/backend-voice-runbook.md`.

## Commands

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `python scripts/bootstrap.py` | Creates `.venv`, installs dependencies, exports OpenAPI, and generates TypeScript API types |
| `python scripts/dev.py` | Runs FastAPI on 8000 and Vite on 5173, stopping both on Ctrl+C |
| `python scripts/check.py` | Runs Ruff, pytest, contract generation, typecheck, frontend tests, and production build |
| `python scripts/export_openapi.py` | Regenerates `packages/contracts/openapi.json` |
| `npm --prefix apps/web run generate:api` | Regenerates `apps/web/src/api/schema.d.ts` |
| `python -m evals.run` | Runs deterministic synthetic intelligence evaluations |

## API routes

| Method | Route | Mock behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/health` | Reports service and selected runtime mode |
| POST | `/api/intake/document` | Creates a fresh unconfirmed job from deterministic document intake |
| POST | `/api/jobs` | Creates an in-memory job at `intake_complete` |
| GET | `/api/jobs/{job_id}` | Returns the typed job aggregate |
| GET | `/api/jobs/{job_id}/events` | Returns safe normalized provider events |
| POST | `/api/jobs/{job_id}/confirm` | Locks the JobSpec and advances to `confirmed` |
| POST | `/api/jobs/{job_id}/calls` | Creates three completed synthetic calls and quotes |
| POST | `/api/jobs/{job_id}/negotiate` | Adds a measurably improved synthetic quote |
| GET | `/api/jobs/{job_id}/report` | Returns the evidence-backed final recommendation |
| POST | `/api/webhooks/elevenlabs` | Authenticates, normalizes, and deduplicates a signed webhook |
| GET | `/api/vendors/discover` | Returns three synthetic vendors |

Illegal state transitions return HTTP 409 with a domain error code. Unknown jobs return HTTP 404.

## Team branch conventions

Branch from `main`, keep work inside the ownership boundaries in `AGENTS.md` and `CODEOWNERS`, and
use names such as `toheeb/orchestration`, `zukhriuddin/data-layer`, `frontend/demo-ui`, or
`arsalan/submission`. Rebase or merge `main` before requesting review; do not rewrite another
member's subsystem to resolve a local preference. Contract changes require coordinated backend and
frontend generation described in `AGENTS.md`. `AGENTS.md` is the source of truth for who owns what,
including the product-narrative and submission ownership in `docs/submission/`.

## Known limitations

- No production voice interview, model inference, or web search is wired.
- The controlled live adapter can initiate at most one opted-in test call; it does not convert live
  post-call data into a canonical quote or complete a live report.
- Strict document parsing and narration boundaries are implemented but no live provider or API route
  is wired in mock mode.
- No Supabase runtime adapter, persistence, authentication, authorization, payment, or booking.
- Mock calls and negotiation complete synchronously.
- The frontend is a functional route scaffold, not a polished production interface.
- In-memory data is single-process and resets on restart.

## Synthetic data

Every vendor, move, policy, quote, transcript excerpt, recording URL, and recommendation in
`data/demo` is fictional and labeled synthetic. Example-domain URLs are not recordings of real
calls. The repository contains no real phone number, home address, customer identity, or personal
moving record.

## Future VeraAI integration

VeraMove remains independent from VeraAI. `JobSpecV1.source_context` contains only nullable
`vera_user_id` and `vera_property_id` identifiers so a future integration can correlate records
without coupling this repository to VeraAI services or authentication.
